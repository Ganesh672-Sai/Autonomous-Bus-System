# Autonomous-Bus-System
Autonomous Bus System for Village Connectivity

1)Dijkstra's Algorithm for shortest path navigationâ€”perfect for determining the most efficient route for the bus through villages.11
2)YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection, ensuring the bus can identify obstacles, pedestrians, and vehicles in real-time.
3)Dual-fuel (electric + fuel-based) vehicle design for better sustainability and range.

  # Self-Driven Project
Developed an autonomous bus with dual power (electric and fuel) for improved sustainability and range.
Implemented Dijkstra's Algorithm for real-time shortest path navigation across multiple villages.
Integrated YOLO-based object detection for obstacle avoidance and safe driving.
Built a companion mobile app for ticket booking, live tracking, and feature-rich user interaction.
